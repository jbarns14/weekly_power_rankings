    "text": "Power Rankings\n\n\nTwo Curls One Kupp Prioritized RB and WR balance with stars at both positions, got good value at QB and TE, and managed to pick up the handcuff to his injury-prone RB1. Great start to the season! Question for the season: Will star players stay healthy?\nLadies Love Cool Jalen Good balance at RB and WR with two elite RBs to rely on. WRs are all the WR1 on their teams and should see heavy volume. Prioritized QB and left TE until the later rounds relying on the depth at the position. Exciting draft! Question for the season: Will leaving TE until late in the draft create a competitive disadvantage at the position?\nNjigbas in Paris Similar roster construction to #2, but prioritized a high-level TE over an Elite QB. An exciting WR corps and 2 Elite RBs will keep this manager from being bored watching his team this year. The lack of the QB’s rushing ability, and a lack of RB depth puts this team at #3. Finally, adding Hockenson in the 13th to create an extra roster space was a nifty move that didn’t go unnoticed. Question for the season: Will second year Rashee Rice and rookie Malik Nabers break out to become stars?\nAss Etienne Szn First of all, outstanding team name! A great WR group and the almost-GOAT TE set up a reliable foundation for this squad. The lack of depth at RB and the QBs inability to score points on the ground are what may limit this team. However, we do like the Sheisty-Chase stack! Question for the season: Will Stevenson or Moss surpass expectations and add some juice to the RB group?\nRico’s Rizzlers An Elite WR, QB, and TE will carry this team to a safe floor each week. The lack of depth at the WR position combined with a WR1 who tends to miss time each year means for this team to explode they’ll need some historically below-average WRs to take a big stride this year. There’s no denying the depth of TE on this team, will this unusual lineup construction translate to success? Let’s wait and see! Question for the season: Can Josh Allen stay the best player in fantasy without a single starting-quality WR to throw to?\nTeam10Chrysler - GET A NAME This team boats one of the best WR groups in the league but lacks star power at RB. A pairing of an up-and-coming TE and a perenially-undervalued QB give this manager a stack we should all watch out for. Question for the season: Will the Cardinals offense take a big step this year and return on this manager’s heavy investment in them?\nBig Dak Energy This was the hardest team to rank. Their season may be the most uncertain. With maybe the highest-variance player in all of fantasy in De’Von Achane, and an RB that is severely volume dependent in Rachaad White, along with two WRs (Deebo Samuel and Stefon Diggs) whos consistent volume is hard to predict, makes it very hard to judge this team. To top it off, Dak Prescott fills the QB spot with another player who could finish the season anywhere from MVP to unsigned over the offseason. Ironically, this team also features maybe the safest first round pick of the draft in Amon-Ra St.Brown. Question of the season: Can Dak and Rachaad repeat their top-5 performances at their positions from last season?\nButker’s Housewife Brigade Hope the volcano was worth drafting Butker and 3 QBs. Bijan and a young WR tandem make up most of the total possible upside of this team. If they excell, we’ll see this team rising up these rankings in the coming weeks. If not, I’m not sure there are many other pieces of this team that can propel them up the ranks. Question of the season: Can Lamar repeat as MVP and give this team a consistent superstar to lean on?\nMike Vick’s Underdogs This team has some question marks. First, can Justin Jefferson prove that he can make any QB into Kirk Cousins? Second, can Drake London, Zay Flowers, and Terry McLaurin take the leap we’ve been for from each of them? They’re all in an exciting environment with serious additions to their offenses, but will they be worth the hype? Finally, a lack of RB depth and the worst TE in the league may mean this team needs to be carried to success by their star QB. Question for this season: Can Saquon pull off the career revival and get back to his explosive, fantasy-breaking self behind a solid Eagles’ O-line?\nThe Dicker McDickersons Welcome to your first season of Barns’ Weekly Power Rankings! With the league’s worst RB group and having reached on a second-year pocket QB, this team will lean on their deep WR room and two solid TEs to drag them up the rankings as the season develops. Question for the season: Will this manager find RB help on the waiver wire or through the trade market?\n\n\n\nDraft Awards\n\nMost Hated Selection Player: Zay Flowers Drafted by: CantGuardBandaidMike Votes: 5 Poops and 1 Thumbs Down Pick: Rd 5 Pick 8\nMost Loved Selection Player: Isaiah Pacheco Drafted by: Two Curls One Kupp Votes: 3 Graduates Pick: Rd 2 Pick 9\nMost Poop Votes Winner: CantGuardBandaidMike - 14 Runner-up: Big Dak Energy - 7 *5 Poops were mistakenly assigned to Ass Etienne Szn"

This year, as we no-longer have our whiteboard, we are happy to bring you BWPR in a brand new, easy to navigate, all in one format! We will be adding new features throughout the season so make sure to check back each week to see what Barns thinks of your squad!\nFinally, our logo is still in development and we are accepting submissions for the new logo of BWPR!"

    "text": "Power Rankings\n\n\nTwo Curls One Kupp    - This team looks strong. Our number one team from last week had a strong opening week, putting up the highest score across the league with Christian McCaffrey sitting on the bench. The likely return of CMC for week 2 means we like Two Curls One Kupp’s chances of starting 2-0.\nRico’s Rizzlers    +3 We found our answer to the question “Will Josh Allen be able to maintain his fantasy dominance with no standout WRs”… Yes, yes he will. The only question now is who is going to start at WR alongside Tyreek next week?\nAss Etienne Szn    +1 This team’s namesake’s backfield appears to be more split than we foresaw. By hoping that Tank Bigsby’s heavy involvement in week 1 doesn’t continue and that the Bengals get their swag back sooner rather than later, and by assuming that Chase and Smith will be back in the lineup for week 2, we foresee this team getting stronger this week.\nNjigbas in Paris    -1 A good showing in week 1 for this squad, but at the cost of their starting QB. With Jordan Love week-to-week, and no backup on the roster, the uncertainty at QB in week 2 drops this team a notch in the power rankings for this week.\nTeam10Chrysler - GET A NAME    +1 Losing Puka Nacua (we like saying his full name) to the IR is a tough hit to this squad, but on the other hand, Jayden Reed looks like the steal of the draft and the James’ heavy usage in week 1 are promising signs of their roles in their offenses. The main question is will Jayden Reed be able to keep it up without Jordan Love at QB? Get a name.\nLadies Love Cool Jalen    -4 A dissapointing week 1 performance by this crew of WRs leaves a lot to be desired going forward. A couple unfavourable matchups and an injured TE lay ahead in week 2 cause a major slide in the rankings for this team.\nBig Dak Energy    - This team faces a very similar situation to the team above, a lack of explosivity from it’s stars in week 1 and an injured TE means this team better turn it around in week 2.\nButker’s Housewife Brigade    - This team’s top 3 WRs are MHJ, Chris Olave, and Amari Cooper. Together they put up 8 pts last week. If they don’t turn things around in a major way next week I have a feeling we’ll see this squad right back here for week 3.\nMike Vick’s Underdogs    - Saquon is the only one of the Underdogs to be pulling his weight. If nobody else starts pitching in, these dogs are gonna stay underdogs.\nThe Dicker McDickersons    - This team’s 2 star WRs didn’t do enough to carry this team to a win in week 1. Unless they put up 35 each going forward, they’re going to need more from other contributors. The apparent irrelavance of Mark Andrews is another panic signal for this manager."

    "text": "Power Rankings\n\n\nAss Etienne Szn    +2  This team is 2-0 and have frankly not been operating anywhere near 100%. If the bengals stack, Taylor Swift’s boyfriend, and the team’s namesake get their act together this team will be hard to beat.\nNjigbas in Paris    +2  The deepest WR room in the league just got a little boost as we expect Brandon Aiyuk to break out of his slump with Deebo out for a couple weeks. If the Lions get their offense moving again this team will be even scarier.\nLadies Love Cool Jalen    +3  The depth of this team is driving its success. Dobbins and Robinson are way outpacing expectations and providing great value from late in the draft. The main question here is will the injuries to the Rams’ WRs help or harm Kyren’s fantasy production?\nButker’s Housewife Brigade    +4  This week we saw many of the questions we had about this team last week laid to rest – MHJ and Brock Bowers looks like the real deal. If Joe Mixon’s ankle turns out not to be a big deal we’ll likely see this team rise another ranking next week. For now, the lack of depth at RB poses a risk.\nTeam10Chrysler - GET A NAME    -  We’d like to put the first place team higher in these rankings but with AJ Brown out for a couple weeks and Jayden Reed appearing not to be a factor without Jordan Love, this team will need Kyler and the James’s to keep carrying them. Hopefully we see the Jets lean on the throttle a little and start putting up some points… if we do, Wilson may begin contributing like the second round pick he is.\nMike Vick’s Underdogs    +3  Saquon is that dude. Jjettas is proving to us once again that he’s QB proof – he’s out here catching 97 yd TDs from Kirk Cousins’ cousin. Drake London showed us that he’s not incompetent. If Ken Walker’s injury persists, Charbonnet will continue to be a great flex start.\nRaheem’s Rizzlers    5  This team drops in the ranking largely due to the concern around Tyreek Hill. It’s difficult to value him the same way without Tua there to force feed him targets each week. This team’s 2 TE strategy also has yet to pay off and is looking questionable with the lack of volume either of the TEs have been getting so far. We can give thanks here to Alvin doing his best impression of his 2020 self.\nBig Dak Energy    -1  We don’t have much to say about this team this week. Achane looks great and the sun god showed us some sign of life this week which is a positive going forward. However, with Deebo gone for a few weeks and Rachaad White potentially banged up this team’s ceiling is low.\nThe Dicker McDickersons    +1  This team took a good step forward in picking up a starting RB. Hopefully Tee Higgins comes back this week and adds some juice to this team, but until we see some upside from this squad it’s hard to move them up too much.\nTwo Curls One Kupp    -9  OOF! I don’t think we’ve ever seen a team go from first to worst in the history of BWPR. You hate to see it, but with each of their first 3 round picks being put on IR, injuries to two other starters, and the rest of the squad underperforming expectations, the situation here is bleak."

    "text": "Power Rankings\n\n\nNjigbas in Paris    +1  Yes, I know I’m about to hear you all screaming and hollering that “this team lost last week so why are they rising in the rankings?” Because Malik Nabers is a monster, Rashee Rice is a monster, the two starting RBs are more than dependable, and Mike Evans and Brandon Aiyuk are both bound to start producing sooner rather than later.\nButker’s Housewife Brigade    +2  Do I expect this team to put 180 pts every week? No, but Chris Olave and Amari Cooper showing signs of life is a good sign! It’s also promising to see Chris Godwin stay consistent as it is to see Monty keep getting this kind of volume. Hopefully Mixon will be back soon.\nAss Etienne Szn    -2  I hate to drop a team that won their matchup to stay undefeated but with the way Etienne is playing, this team is highly reliant (maybe too reliant) on the success of the Bengal’s offence. It was important to see Burrow and Chase finally play at the level we’re used to – for God’s sake, hopefully Kelce can follow suit this week! Devonta Smith getting concussed doesn’t help.\nLadies Love Cool Jalen    -1  Two of the top 5 RBs in fantasy lead the the way for this squad. Two elite QB options, provide a safe floor at the position and the WR room provides safe production. TE is a problem here for sure, but we don’t expect to see a 0 from the kicker every week.\nMike Vick’s Underdogs    +1  I think we just saw this team’s ceiling. Saquon is an animal and he’ll need to keep being one to keep carrying this squad on his back. Dallas Goedert was a great start (check the DSOW) and he is likely in line for some more volume if Devonta and AJ Brown miss next week, but we can’t expect production like this from him every week. Further, Zach Charbonnet was a nice pickup for a couple weeks but with Ken Walker expected back soon, we can’t expect him to stay startable.\nRaheem’s Rizzlerss    +1  Yes, Lebron is right, it’s very fun to watch Josh Allen play football – and maybe even moreso to watch him play fantasy football. It’s also fun to watch King Henry play like he did 2 years ago, so we moved this team up one because he showed us he can still pull a performance like that out of his hat now and then. However, I don’t expect him to see volume or efficiency like that every week. The reason this team doesn’t move up higher is that the WR position is still an issue. Tyreek was drafted to be the WR1 overall and now it’s questionable if he’s even reliable WR1 for his team. You have lots of RBs and Mike Vick’s Underdogs have lots of WRs… I can smell a trade that might bump you both up the rankings.\nTeam10Chrysler - GET A NAME    -2  I know, I know, they’re 3-0, but they just beat our last ranked team and lost their star TE to a concussion in the process. With AJ Brown and Trey McBride out and Garrett Wilson not producing like a 2nd round pick should be, this team isn’t as threatening as they could be with everyone in the lineup.\nBig Dak Energy    -  0-3 is a tough spot to be. It’s nice to see Dak put up a big day, but equally dissapointing to see the ’boys defense drop a deuce on the field like that. Will we see Achane keep putting up the numbers he did in week 1 and 2 or will opposing defenses focus on taking him out of the game with Skylar Thompson under center?\nThe Dicker McDickersons    -  Week 3 was this team’s best chance at a win so far, with their opponent putting up only 110, but they weren’t able to scrape together enough production from their star WRs. Hopefully we see CeeDee and Dak get back on the rhythm se wee from them last year as this team will never get near their ceiling without CeeDee and Davante carrying the load.\nTwo Curls One Kupp    -  I’m not certain but I think 79 pts is probably near the lowest we’ve seen a team put up in this league. Things are looking bleak here. Hopefully Ken Walker can come back to help this team out but even then, they won’t be too scary until their big names come back from injury and their Colts’ stack come to life."
